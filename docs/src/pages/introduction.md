## What is SvelteUI?

SvelteUI is a Svelte library with a variety of packages to help make development easier! This library not only aims to be more than just a component library, but one that fits all the needs of a project. SvelteUI aims to take care of the boring and complicated stuff for you so that you can start building quickly.

Instead of remaking the same components, recreating custom actions, transitions, utilities, etc. SvelteUI is designed so you can start making projects quickly. It works amazingly well **out-of-the-box, with zero-configuration, and can be customized** to your liking as your application grows.

### Features

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and SSR Compatible
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) and type definitions are supported, but optional.
- All components are accessible according to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) standards.
- Dark theme included, as well as a custom theming api.
- Highly customizable
- Minimal to no third-party dependency usage.
- Easy setup - **Zero Configuration**

### Undocumented Components

> The docs are still under construction. Some of the library's exported components & functions are still undocumented.
